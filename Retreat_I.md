## Student Learning Outcomes

### Student Learning Outcomes LLC Department

1. 	Recognize the specificity of cultural products (i.e., art, music, literature, digital media, etc.) without essentializing them as separate from the world at large, using critical and analytic skills
2. Clearly understand what others are saying in the target language(s) and have confidence in making themselves clearly understood in that same language(s) (both formally and informally).
3. Present emotions, statements, information, and data through varied discursive structures (i.e., narrative, expositive, argumentative), using a variety of strategies to communicate their point both in their own language as well as in the target language(s).
4. Compare practices and social norms between their own and other cultures with empathy, using information gathered through research processes, without imposing value judgments.
5. Communicate my needs to others using the appropriate structures, vocabulary and expressions enough to survive in the target language(s)



## Activities with Student Learning Outcomes (Retreat)

1. Review SLO with your group. We'll ask professors for languages like Hebrew, Chinese, Latin, ASL, Arabic to get together and form a group. The idea is to discuss and re-think the SLO's we developed throughout the year. Use this opportunity to revise, edit, add and/or change existing SLO's. Each program must report back a list of 3-5 SLO [Report back after completing the activity]


2. As a big group, discuss the student learning outcomes for Comparative Literature, our transversal program. We aim to revise and edit (if necessary) the list of 6 SLO's we currently have. 


3. With your group, work on the curricular map. You need to think how each of the courses contribute to the development of the proposed SLO's. By the end of this activity we'll have a curricular map for every program (except Comp. Lit.) [Report back afer completing the activity]


4. As a big group, we collaborate to generate the Comp. Lit. curricular map. Since this is an interdisciplinary and inter-departmental major, we may have an incomplete map. We need to reflect on what we actually want our students to achieve taking our program in Comp. Lit.


5. Review, discuss, revise and edit the list of 5 SLO's we curated last semester. What would you change? What would you add? The main objective is to come up with a final list that wil be published on our website and that will guide our curricular development going forward.
