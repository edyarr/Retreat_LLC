## The furture of Combined Languages, Comp. Lit., German, ASL and Study Abroad at LLC (12:30pm-2:45pm)

This space is to discuss the future of these interdisciplinary programs. As we know, Bob Tobin was central to all of thes eprograms and we need to discuss what we want of these programs going forward. 

The session is planned as free discussion session with some guiding questions: 

### Questions: 

* Combined languages is a complex program that require coordination and collaboration. How do we want this program to be going forward in connection with the so-called "orphan languages"?
* Study abroad is a requirement for all of our programs (including Combined Languages). What policies do we want to set for study abroad and combination of languages? 
* How do we design a experience that allow students to do combined languages, get the combined language experience (with small langauge programs) and still be able to acquire a good level o proficiency? 
* What level of proficiency we want students in the combined languages major to graduate with from LLC?
* Comparative Literature is one important compnent of our department. How do we envision this program going forward?
* As an interdiscplinary major, Comp. Lit. requires coordination with diverse departments. What shoul we do regarding the coordination of the major?
* German is a small program that don't have a lot of students in it. Do we want to continue offering German beyond the beginner levels? If so, how do you envision this program going forward?
* ASL is a language growing in popularity and interest among the studnets. Do we want to continue offering ASL as an option for the Combined Languages program even if we don't have a robust program?
* ASL could be an entry-door to create a new track on disability studies from the language and cultural perspective. How do you seee a program like this being offered and developed here at Clark?
* Study abroad is a central component to all of our majors. How do you think we should approach it going forward? Should we continue with a third-party model? Should we bring study abroad back to faculty control? Should we implement and develop a hybrid model? 
* What shoudl we do with students who, despite being US studnets, have international background, recent international experiences and cultural experiences abroad? Should we wave the study abroad requirement for these students? 
* What other alternatives we should have to the study abroad experience? 


**We'll keep an inventory of ideas so we can develop plans and proposals going forward**
